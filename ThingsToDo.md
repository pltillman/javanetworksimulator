# To DO list #

  1. **Come up with a block diagram and some pseudocode of the project**
  1. **Decide on team meeting times** - post schedules in a new wiki and we'll come up with something.
  1. **Decide what language we're going to code this in** - my vote is for java, but we can try and tackle whatever you guys are up for.
  1. **.... more to come.**
