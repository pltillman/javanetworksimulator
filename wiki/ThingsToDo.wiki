#summary Just a simple list of things we need to get done in no particular order.
#labels todolist,patrick

= To DO list =

#  *Come up with a block diagram and some pseudocode of the project*

#  *Decide on team meeting times* - post schedules in a new wiki and we'll come up with something.

#  *Decide what language we're going to code this in* - my vote is for java, but we can try and tackle whatever you guys are up for.

#  *.... more to come.*
